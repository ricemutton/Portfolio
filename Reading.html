            <p>Reading has been a big part of my learning. These are some of the books that I time and again go back to. You can find me on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171386117-sharada-poudel">goodreads</a> to see all the books I have read so far and their reviews.</p>

            <h4>Non-Fiction</h4>
            <ul class="Booknames">
                <li><h4>The Art of Logical Reasoning</h4></li>
                <p>This is the book that sparked my interest in mathematics and logic.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <li><h4>The Diary of a Young Girl</h4></li>
                <p>The book that got me started with reading book. I was 15 when I read the book. Boy did it hooked me up to reading.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <li><h4>The Existential Pleasures of Engineering</h4></li>
                <p>I read the book in 2018. For the 16 year old me, it must be the first of its kind book. It showed me the bigger picture of being an engineer. One of the reason why I picked it is because I wanted to learn the ethical and philosophical side of engineering.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <li><h4>The Myth of Sisyphus</h4></li>
                <p>I found the book to be very dense and it took a fairly big dedication than expected. It came into my life when I was actually questioning the existence overall.</p>
                <hr><br>
                <h4>Fiction</h4>
                <li><h4>The Fault in our Stars</h4></li>
                <p>The book is in the romantic end. The book is a reminder of how sometimes life can be too tough to live yet there are people who make their time worthwhile.</p>
