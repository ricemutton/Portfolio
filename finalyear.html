                <p>Human is said to be a curious being from birth. As one indulges oneself into formal education that does not encourage curiosity, the ultimate feature that makes human a human fades. With a series of events in 2023, I observed it was happening with me. <br>In a quest to understand why is something the way it is, I read a book on the art of logical thinking. I found a brand now introduction to the subject of mathematics. A knowledge that the little mysteries of the world could be solved by some abstract symbols. From then on, Mathematics has been a way of making sense of the world around me. I feel the child in me is reborn nonetheless a little older, a little wiser.<br> Hi, I am Sharada Poudel. I play chess, guitar and am interested in philosophy as well. </p>
