                <h5>Bangalore</h5><hr>
                <p>My first ever international travel by air. It was a solo trip. I knew no one in the big city. Coming from Nepal, the northern region of India doesn't feel much strange but the southern region is a very new experience. <br> I stayed in Electronic City Phase II for a month in Bangalore. It is in outskirts of Bangalore which I got to know after I reached there. However, the experience of being there was a delight. The place had a beautiful blend of culture and empowerment. The place gave me strength to believe in my strength as a woman. The whole month was full of learning. With all the time to myself, I learned Python and Julia, built this portfolio, applied to jobs and landed an interview (which I couldn't join because I had to return to Nepal for personal reasons).<br>I then planned a trip to Alleppey before my return.

                <h5>Alleppey</h5><hr>
                <p>The first place I visited as a tourist. It was fun. The planning was to cover Alleppey, Varkala and Tiruvanthapuram. But I loved the place so much I ended up staying there for a week. </p>
